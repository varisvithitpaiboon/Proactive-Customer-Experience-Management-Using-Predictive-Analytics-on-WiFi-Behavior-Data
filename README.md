# Lifemote â€“ Predictive Analytics on WiFi Data

This project applies predictive analytics and machine learning to proactively manage customer experience and reduce operational costs for Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Developed in collaboration with **Lifemote**, a Turkish SaaS company specializing in broadband network analytics, the work focuses on two key objectives:
1. **Predict broadband connectivity issues** within the next 7 days using 14 days of historical network data. (Succeeded)
2. **Identify customers likely to contact customer service** based on 3 days of recent network behavior. (Failed)

## Project Overview

**Goal:** Enable ISPs to take proactive actions by predicting future faults and anticipating customer calls, reducing churn, improving service quality, and optimizing operational resources.

**Key Benefits for ISPs:**
- Reduce inventory holding costs by forecasting the number of faults.
- Optimize workforce scheduling.
- Increase customer satisfaction by resolving issues before customers notice.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Data Sources**: 30 days of network behavior metrics & customer call logs.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Remove low-variance and high-missing-rate features.
  - Merge network and call datasets.
  - Create target labels `flag_fault` (connectivity issue) and `flag_call` (customer call).

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **TSFRESH** for time-series feature extraction.
- Manual features for call prediction (lag, delta, ratios).
- Multicollinearity check via Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

### 3. Modeling
#### **Connectivity Issues Prediction**
- Models: Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM.
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC, PR AUC.

#### **Customer Call Prediction**
- **Semi-supervised**: IsolationForest anomaly scores + classification.
- **Unsupervised**: Autoencoder anomaly detection.
- Evaluation Metrics: PR AUC, Precision@K, Recall@K.

#### **Clustering**
- DBSCAN on UMAP-projected data to detect caller behavior patterns.

## Key Results

**Connectivity Issues Prediction (Best Model: XGBoost)**
| Metric   | Score  |
|----------|--------|
| Precision| 0.6445 |
| Recall   | 0.7617 |
| F1-score | 0.6982 |
| PR-AUC   | 0.7742 |
| ROC-AUC  | 0.8487 |

**Customer Call Prediction**
- Semi-supervised & unsupervised methods performed poorly due to extreme class imbalance (0.07% positive).
- Abnormal network behavior alone is not a strong predictor of customer calls.

**DBSCAN Clustering Analysis**
- 7 distinct caller behavior patterns identified, offering insights for targeted maintenance.
